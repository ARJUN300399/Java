# REST API Concepts and Spring Boot HTTP Methods

## 1. What is a REST API?

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that developers follow when creating an API. These rules include guidelines on how a server should expose certain resources to clients, using standard HTTP methods. REST APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and easily maintained.

## 2. Key Concepts of REST

### a. Resource

- **Definition**: In REST, a resource is an object or representation of something which has data. A resource is identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
- **Example**: A resource can be a product, user, order, etc. Each product can be identified by a unique URI such as `/products/101`.

### b. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

- **Definition**: A URI is a string of characters used to identify a resource. It is typically in the form of a URL.
- **Example**: `http://example.com/products/101` is a URI identifying the product with ID 101.

### c. HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Retrieve a resource.
- **POST**: Create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
- **DELETE**: Delete a resource.

### d. Stateless

- **Definition**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any state about the client session.
- **Implication**: This simplifies the server design because it does not need to manage client state.

### e. Client-Server Architecture

- **Definition**: The client and server are separate entities. The client requests resources, and the server provides those resources.
- **Advantage**: This separation allows for better scalability and independent development of client and server components.

### f. Cacheable

- **Definition**: Responses from the server should explicitly indicate if they are cacheable or not, to improve performance on the client side by reusing responses.
- **Implementation**: HTTP headers like `Cache-Control` can be used to define cacheability.

### g. Layered System

- **Definition**: The architecture allows for an application to be composed of multiple layers. Each layer has its functionality, and the client does not need to know about all the layers.
- **Example**: A proxy server can be placed between the client and the server to handle tasks like load balancing and security.

### h. Uniform Interface

- **Definition**: The uniform interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently.
- **Constraints**: It includes resource identification through URIs, manipulation of resources through representations, self-descriptive messages, and hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS).

## 3. RESTful API Design Best Practices

### a. Use Nouns for Resources

- **Example**: Use `/products` rather than `/getProducts`.

### b. Use HTTP Methods Appropriately

- **GET**: Fetch resources. Should not modify any state.
- **POST**: Create a new resource or perform an action that changes state.
- **PUT**: Update a resource. Can be used to create a resource if the client specifies the resource identifier.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

### c. Stateless Operations

- Each request should be standalone with all necessary information to understand and process it.

### d. Use Proper HTTP Status Codes

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a resource was created.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response.
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition.

### e. Use JSON for Responses

- JSON is the most common format for RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and readability.

## 4. Example REST API

### Resource: Product

- **URI**: `/products`, `/products/{id}`
- **HTTP Methods**:
  - **GET /products**: Fetch all products.
  - **GET /products/{id}**: Fetch a product by ID.
  - **POST /products**: Add a new product.
  - **PUT /products/{id}**: Update an existing product.
  - **DELETE /products/{id}**: Delete a product.

## 5. Example Implementation Details

**ProductService.java**:
- Manages the business logic related to products.

**ProductController.java**:
- Exposes the product-related endpoints.

### Example Endpoints

```java
@RestController
public class ProductController {
    @Autowired
    ProductService pService;

    // Fetch all products
    @GetMapping("/products")
    public List<Product> getProduct() {
        return pService.getProducts();
    }

    // Fetch a product by ID
    @GetMapping("/products/{id}")
    public Product getProductById(@PathVariable int id) {
        return pService.getProductById(id);
    }

    // Add a new product
    @PostMapping("/products")
    public void addProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        pService.addProduct(product);
    }

    // Update an existing product
    @PutMapping("/products/{id}")
    public void updateProduct(@PathVariable int id, @RequestBody Product product) {
        pService.updateProduct(id, product);
    }

    // Delete a product
    @DeleteMapping("/products/{id}")
    public void deleteProduct(@PathVariable int id) {
        pService.deleteProduct(id);
    }
}
```

In summary, a RESTful API design focuses on resources and uses standard HTTP methods to interact with those resources. Each HTTP method has a specific role, and the design should ensure that the operations are stateless, cacheable, and use proper HTTP status codes for responses. This approach ensures scalability, simplicity, and maintainability in web applications.
