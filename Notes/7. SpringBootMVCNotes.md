# Spring Boot MVC and Layers

Spring Boot MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications and RESTful services in Java. It is built on the core Spring framework and provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable way to develop web applications.

## Key Concepts and Layers in Spring Boot MVC

1. **Model:**
   - The model represents the data of the application. It can be a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) or a more complex entity.
   - The model objects contain data that is sent to the view or received from the view.
   - Example: `Product` class

2. **View:**
   - The view is responsible for rendering the model data to the user. In web applications, this is usually an HTML page, but it can also be JSON or XML in the case of RESTful services.
   - In Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, or JSP can be used for creating views.

3. **Controller:**
   - The controller handles HTTP requests and maps them to specific service methods. It acts as an intermediary between the view and the model.
   - Example: `ProductController` class

4. **Service:**
   - The service layer contains business logic and calls the data access layer (repository) to fetch or save data.
   - Services are annotated with `@Service`.
   - Example: `ProductService` class

5. **Repository:**
   - The repository layer is responsible for data persistence. It interacts with the database and performs CRUD operations.
   - Spring Data JPA or similar libraries can be used for repository implementation.

## Example Code with Explanations

### Model Class

The `Product` class represents the model in the application. It contains fields for the product ID, name, and price, along with getter and setter methods.

```java
package com.java.simpleWebApp.model;

public class Product {
    private int pId;
    private String pName;
    private int pPrice;

    public Product(int pId, String pName, int pPrice) {
        this.pId = pId;
        this.pName = pName;
        this.pPrice = pPrice;
    }

    public Product() {
    }

    public int getpId() {
        return pId;
    }

    public void setpId(int pId) {
        this.pId = pId;
    }

    public String getpName() {
        return pName;
    }

    public void setpName(String pName) {
        this.pName = pName;
    }

    public int getpPrice() {
        return pPrice;
    }

    public void setpPrice(int pPrice) {
        this.pPrice = pPrice;
    }
}
```

### Service Class

The `ProductService` class contains the business logic for the application. It is annotated with `@Service`, indicating that it is a service component in the Spring context.

```java
package com.java.simpleWebApp.service;

import com.java.simpleWebApp.model.Product;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@Service
public class ProductService {
    private List<Product> products = Arrays.asList(
        new Product(101, "HPLaptop", 59000),
        new Product(102, "DELL Desktop", 29000),
        new Product(103, "Old Monk", 290)
    );

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return products;
    }
}
```

### Controller Class

The `ProductController` class handles HTTP requests and maps them to the service methods. It is annotated with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.

```java
package com.java.simpleWebApp.controller;

import com.java.simpleWebApp.model.Product;
import com.java.simpleWebApp.service.ProductService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {

    @Autowired
    private ProductService pService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return pService.getProducts();
    }
}
```

## Explanation of `@Service` Annotation

The `@Service` annotation is a specialization of the `@Component` annotation. It indicates that a class is a service component in the Spring context. The main purpose of `@Service` is to encapsulate the business logic of the application. Services often interact with repositories to fetch and save data, and they may also perform other business operations.

### Key Points about `@Service` Annotation

- **Role in the Application:**
  - `@Service` indicates that the annotated class is a service layer component.
  - It is used to define business logic and service-related tasks.

- **Spring Context:**
  - Spring will automatically detect classes annotated with `@Service` and register them as beans in the application context.
  - This allows the service to be injected into other components, such as controllers.

- **Example Usage:**
  - The `ProductService` class is annotated with `@Service`, making it a Spring service component.
  - It encapsulates the business logic for managing products.

By following these conventions and using the provided annotations, you can create a well-structured Spring Boot application with clear separation of concerns across different layers.
