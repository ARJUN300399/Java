# Dependency Injection in Spring Boot

## Quick Revision:
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Design pattern where a class's dependencies are provided by an external source.
- **Spring Boot:** Uses DI extensively to manage the lifecycle and dependencies of beans.

## Detailed Explanation:
In Spring Boot, Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental design principle that helps manage the dependencies of various components in an application. The Spring Frameworkâ€™s Inversion of Control (IoC) container is responsible for creating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of beans.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Inversion of Control (IoC):** The control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the application code to the Spring container.
2. **Beans:** Objects that are managed by the Spring IoC container.
3. **Annotations:** Common annotations used for DI in Spring Boot include:
    - `@Autowired`: Used for automatic dependency injection.
    - `@Component`: Marks a Java class as a Spring component.
    - `@Service`: Indicates a service layer class.
    - `@Repository`: Indicates a data repository class.
    - `@Controller`: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller.

## Types of Dependency Injection:
1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
3. **Field Injection:** Dependencies are injected directly into the fields.

## Example in Spring Boot:

```java
// Main application class
package com.java.myApp;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyAppApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyAppApplication.class, args);
        Dev obj = context.getBean(Dev.class);
        obj.build();
    }
}
```

```java
// Component class
package com.java.myApp;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Dev {
    public void build() {
        System.out.println("Learning Spring Boot");
    }
}
```

## Explanation of the Example:
1. **MyAppApplication:** The main class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which bootstraps the application. It uses the Spring ApplicationContext to get the `Dev` bean and call its `build` method.
2. **Dev:** A class annotated with `@Component`, indicating that it is a Spring-managed component. The `build` method prints a message to the console.

## Key Annotations:
- `@SpringBootApplication`: A convenience annotation that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` with their default attributes.
- `@Component`: Indicates that a class is a Spring-managed component, allowing it to be autodetected through classpath scanning and registered as a bean.

In Spring Boot, the IoC container automatically wires the dependencies, making the development process simpler and more manageable.
